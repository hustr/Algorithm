The White House said Mrs Trump underwent an embolization procedure The Johns Hopkins Patients Guide to Kidney Cancer describes an arterial embolization as a procedure in which a special spongelike material is placed into an artery that supplies blood to the kidney A thin tube catheter is inserted into a vessel in the leg and into the main vessel feeding the kidney
Such a procedure would block the blood supply that feeds the kidney and might be used to stop bleeding from a benign tumor a small aneurysm or to reverse the growth of such a tumor according to specialists The Johns Hopkins guide said it can also be used to make it easier for a surgeon to remove the kidney but is more frequently used to control symptoms for someone who cannot undergo surgery

Vice President Mike Pence said on Monday that Mrs Trump s procedure was long planned citing her visit to Walter Reed as the reason Mr Trump had sent him to represent the administration at a reception hosted by the Israeli Embassy to celebrate the th anniversary of Israeli independence
The fact that Mrs Trump will remain in the hospital for the rest of the week was unusual in the most typical cases according to leading medical experts
It s like literally an outpatient procedure said Dr Eleanor D Lederer a professor at the University of Louisville School of Medicine and past president of the American Society of Nephrology You go in you have it done you lie in bed for a while to keep the blood vessel from bleeding and then you go home

Another doctor however said Mrs Trump was probably being kept in the hospital longer because of her position That s because she is the first lady said Dr Jeffrey Cadeddu a professor of urology and radiology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas If it was you you d be in and out in a day I promise
Still embolization kills some surrounding healthy kidney tissue which causes swelling and pain as a patient recovers so a longer stay could be helpful or necessary doctors said
The White House did not explain what led Mrs Trump to seek treatment or whether the benign kidney condition meant she had a benign tumor or something else Specialists said it could be that doctors had been monitoring a mass for a while and decided to act on it now because it had grown Or they said it could be that she experienced symptoms of some sort like noticing blood in the urine or experiencing back pain or stomach pain
Doctors may also have discovered bleeding while conducting routine tests for other reasons
Dr Joseph A Vassalotti the chief medical officer at the National Kidney Foundation said his guess was that Mrs Trump had either a benign tumor known as an angiomyolipoma or a bleeding cyst It sounds like it was a benign tumor he said
Dr David G Warnock an emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and a past president of the kidney foundation said doctors frequently perform an embolization if a biopsy or other diagnostic procedure causes bleeding
My list of benign conditions that you d embolize is pretty short he said Ninety percent of them are to stop bleeding after some procedure like a kidney biopsy
But Dr Joseph V Bonventre chief of the renal unit at Brigham and Women s Hospital in Boston said that it was unlikely Mrs Trump would have a biopsy on this type of tumor and that doctors probably decided to conduct the embolization procedure to prevent a benign tumor from growing by starving it of blood and therefore oxygen
In general you want to embolize it because you don t want it to continue to get bigger and erode into the larger vessels of the kidney where it can cause significant bleeding he said He added that embolizing in this case was most likely a preventive thing
The procedure came just a week after Mrs Trump formally kicked off a public campaign to encourage children to put kindness first in their lives particularly on social media She has generally maintained a low profile during her months as first lady focusing primarily on raising her son Barron
Mrs Trump makes a point of leading a healthy lifestyle In New York she has said she would walk with ankle weights and eat seven pieces of fruit every day I live a healthy life I take care of my skin and my body she told GQ in I m against Botox I m against injections I think it s damaging your face damaging your nerves It s all me I will age gracefully as my mom does
The health of first ladies has long been a factor in White House life Three first ladies died while living in the White House Letitia Tyler wife of John Tyler Caroline Harrison wife of Benjamin Harrison and Ellen Wilson wife of Woodrow Wilson and Andrew Jackson s wife Rachel died between his election and inauguration
Others have suffered serious ailments that for much of the country s history were shrouded from the public In recent decades first ladies have been more open although not in every instance Betty Ford set the tone for modern times by being open about having a mastectomy to fight breast cancer Following her example Nancy Reagan also disclosed her own mastectomy although she limited the details released
Barbara Bush disclosed her Graves disease a thyroid condition while living in the White House Her daughter in law Laura Bush however did not reveal that she had a skin cancer tumor removed from her shin until weeks later deeming it no big deal at the time
